      first box grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns specify the sizing for grid tracks that are generated
      automatically. The properties come-in really handy when you want to be able to add items that will spill onto new
      rows/columns, but want to retain some control over the sizing of the implicitly created rows/columns.

      Both properties default to a value of auto and they are defined on the grid container (the element with display:
      grid). Let‚Äôs take this example where we define 2 columns and 2 rows, but place items on a 3rd column and a 3rd
      row:

      .container {
      grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 100px;

      grid-auto-rows: 125px;
      grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
      }

      .item-1 {
      grid-column: 3;
      }

      .item-2 {
      grid-row: 3;
      }
      We placed our two items outside of the grid we‚Äôve defined so the 3rd column and row are auto-generated, but we
      control their size with grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns. You can see the result below with our item-1
      occupying a 1fr column and our item-2 occupying a 125px row:

      Item 1
      Item 2
